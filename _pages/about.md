I am **Su Qun**, currently a second-year PhD student at the Artificial Intelligence for Drug Discovery Laboratory, Zhejiang University, under the supervision of **Professor Tingjun Hou**.  
My research primarily focuses on the development and application of **Deep Potential**, combined with drug-related **molecular docking**, **binding free energy prediction**, and **molecular generation**.  
I am dedicated to advancing innovations and practical applications of artificial intelligence technologies in drug discovery.

During my undergraduate studies, I earned dual bachelor's degrees in **Chemistry** and **Software Engineering** from Sichuan University, providing me with an interdisciplinary background that effectively bridges computational methods and medicinal chemistry research.

Welcome friends and colleagues from all fields for communication and collaboration!
